## An existing network used by linstor to communicate and replication
drbd_replication_network: 172.17.0.0/24

## Overrides controllers list for linstor-client.conf, should you want to use a VIP (with keepalived for example)

linstor_pools:
- name: my_pool1
  ## Pool type: filethin or lvmthin
  type: lvmthin
  ## Only for lvmthin, list of disks (if they are the same on all hosts) OR a list of ansible inventory hostnames and physical devices list
  physical_disks:
  - host: node1
    ## Better to reference by id or UUID since /dev/sdX mappings can change from one reboot to another
    disks: /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0HC_Volume_12345
  - host: node2
    disks:
    - /dev/sdc
    - /dev/sdd

  ## You can also combine host/disks with just disks
  - /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-xyz
  ## Only for lvmthin, optionally specify pool size in LVM format. See https://linux.die.net/man/8/lvcreate#:~:text=%FREE
